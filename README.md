# June 2024: Portal Physics!

## What is Mechanically Challenged?

Mechanically Challenged is a monthly challenge hosted by MooNiZZ and Captain
Coder's Academy in which members of the community recreate different mechanics
found in games! The goal is to create a library of references and examples for
these mechanics in as many different engines and languages as possible.

## June 2024: Portal Physics!

This months mechanic is Portals!

17 years ago Valve released [Portal](https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/), a mind-blowing game for its time. Today, many consider it to be a classic that that holds up very well today. The main mechanic in the game is Portals! You can place 2 different portals anywhere and when you enter one of them you come out through the other, keeping your momentum and your rotation is changed based on the portals rotation!

The challenge for this month is to recreate the physics behavior of portals in a 2D or 3D environment. Optional bonus points if you can recreate the visual and placement behaviors.

### Requirements:
* Be able to go through a portal and come out through the other portal, both ways.
* Keep the momentum when you go through the portals
* Rotate the player and objects that travel through the portals based on the orientation of the portals.

### Optional:
* The visuals! When you look at a portal it would be great to see through it!
* Be able to place portals as a player

judge. The judges will be looking for clean implementations that can be utilized
by new developers to implement the mechanic.

## How to Participate

1. Implement a solution using any language / engine / tools you would like!
2. Create a fork of this repository
3. Within your fork, create a folder that follows the following structure:
   `{EngineName}/{LanguageName}/{UserName}`

For example, if I were using `Godot 3` using `C#` and my username was `The
Captain Coder`, I would create a folder called `Godot3/CSharp/TheCaptainCoder`.

4. Add a minimal version of your solution to that folder. This is typically an
   importable package that contains the necessary source code, assets, and demo
   scene(s).
5. Add a README.md to your folder that explains how to utilize your solution
   (e.g. how to import and see the demo)
6. Create a Pull Request with your solution
7. We may ask you to make minor modifications to your folder names during the PR
   process
8. ???
9.  Profit!
